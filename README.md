# LÖVE Battle City
Welcome to the Battle City Clone project! This is a personal take on recreating the classic tank shooter game, built using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org) framework for 2D game development. Inspired by the original gameplay and mechanics, this project brings nostalgic action and strategy in a modernized environment.

This project draws significant inspiration from an excellent repository that served as a foundation and guide during development([Link](https://github.com/krystiankaluzny/Tanks)) Feel free to explore, modify, or expand upon this clone as part of your own learning journey or game development passion.
